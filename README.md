# Cancer Tumor Classification

## Brief Problem Statement:
This project aims to develop a classification model that accurately distinguishes between malignant and benign tumours using the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. This dataset contains features computed from fine needle aspirate images of breast masses. By leveraging these features, the model aims to support early and reliable breast cancer diagnosis, ultimately improving patient outcomes through timely treatment.



## Dataset: 
name: Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic)  
data_url: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/17/data.csv  
abstract: Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database.  
area: Health and Medicine  
characteristics: ['Multivariate']  
num_instances: 569  
num_features: 30  

Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass.  They describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.  
the data inspects 1-4 features for each cell over 1-3 separating planes.
